# interval-censored-dnn

This is the implementation of **Deep Learning for Regression Analysis of Interval-Censored Data**. In the simulations, we consider four cases about $g_0(X)$. The four folders(**Model_Case1, Model_Case2, Model_Case3, Model_Case4**) present the codes for the corresponding cases. In addition, to compare with the NN-IC method proposed by Sun and Ding (2022, Biometrics), we conduct some simulations and the experimental codes can be found in the folders **Compare_NN_IC(Scenario1)--Compare_NN_IC(Scenario5)**. Finally, the folder **Real_data** shows the analysis for the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. You can get the corresponding results by running the main codes.
